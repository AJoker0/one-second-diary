# 📸 One Second Diary (Photo Edition)

Capture your day in a single photo — every day.

This is a minimalist **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that lets users take or upload one photo per day and later generate a GIF-style montage of their memories. Works offline and can be installed to your home screen just like a native app.

## 🌟 Features

- 📅 **Daily Photo Upload** — One photo per day, automatically tracked.
- 🗓️ **Calendar View** — Visual timeline of your photo history.
- 🧠 **Duplicate Prevention** — Can't upload multiple photos for the same day.
- 🎞️ **GIF Montage Generator** — Create animated photo compilations (7, 30, or 365 days).
- 📲 **PWA Support** — Installable app experience with offline-ready support.
- 🔒 **Privacy First** — No user data is uploaded; everything stays local.
- ⏰ **Reminder-Friendly** — Easy to integrate with mobile notifications (future).
